# Image-Based-Attendance-System
The Image-Based Attendance Management System is an automated MATLAB application that uses face recognition technology to streamline attendance tracking. It captures and registers faces in real-time, enabling accurate identification and attendance marking while reducing manual entry errors, enhancing efficiency in educational and organizations.

## Required Toolboxes and Add-ons

This project utilizes several MATLAB toolboxes and add-ons to implement the face recognition attendance system effectively. The following components are required:

1. **Computer Vision Toolbox**: Provides algorithms and functions for image processing, feature extraction, and object detection.
2. **Deep Learning Toolbox**: Used for designing and implementing deep learning models, particularly for face recognition.
3. **Deep Learning Toolbox Converter for ONNX Model Format**: Facilitates the conversion of deep learning models to the ONNX format for interoperability.
4. **Deep Learning Toolbox Model for AlexNet Network**: Implements the AlexNet architecture for image classification tasks.
5. **Image Processing Toolbox**: Essential for image manipulation and analysis, including filtering, transformation, and enhancement.
6. **MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams**: Enables webcam access to capture real-time images for face recognition.
7. **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox**: Provides statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to enhance the recognition process.

Ensure that you have these toolboxes installed in your MATLAB environment to run the project successfully.
